Types
=====

In C programming, it's essential to choose the correct data types for variables and function parameters to ensure clarity, efficiency, and portability. Whenever possible, use fixed-width types from `stdint.h`, such as `uint8_t`, `uint32_t`, `int16_t`, and `int_fast8_t`. These types guarantee the size of the data and improve cross-platform compatibility.

General Guidelines for Types
----------------------------

- **Use Fixed-Width Integer Types**: Always use specific integer types like `uint8_t`, `int16_t`, `uint32_t`, etc., rather than using `int`, `long`, or other platform-dependent types. Fixed-width types provide clarity and ensure that the size of the variable is consistent across platforms.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: c

    uint8_t counter = 0;  /* Preferred over "int" */

- **Use `int_fastN_t` for Performance**: When performance is critical and you don't need a specific width, use `int_fast8_t`, `int_fast16_t`, etc. These types are at least as large as the number specified, but may be faster on certain platforms.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: c

    int_fast16_t sum = 0;

- **Use `size_t` for Sizes and Memory-Related Variables**: Use `size_t` for variables that hold sizes, memory-related values, or counts of objects. This type ensures portability and correctness when dealing with memory and sizes.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: c

    size_t buffer_size = 1024;

- **Avoid Platform-Dependent Types**: Avoid using platform-dependent types such as `long`, `short`, `int`, or `char` unless absolutely necessary. Instead, use `int8_t`, `int16_t`, `uint32_t`, and similar types to ensure cross-platform behavior.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: c

    int16_t temperature = 25;  /* Preferred over "short" */

- **Use `bool` for Boolean Values**: When representing boolean values, use `bool` (from `stdbool.h`). Avoid using integers for this purpose, as `bool` makes the code more readable and self-explanatory.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: c

    bool is_valid = true;  /* Preferred over "int is_valid = 1" */

- **Use Typedefs for Complex Data Structures**: When dealing with structures, unions, or other complex data types, use `typedef` to give them meaningful names, making the code cleaner and easier to read.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: c

    typedef struct {
      uint8_t  id;
      uint16_t age;
      bool     is_active;
    } user_info_t;

Example 1:
----------

Bad Example:

.. code-block:: c

    int count = 0; /* INCORRECT: Use of "int" instead of fixed-width type */

Good Example:

.. code-block:: c

    uint8_t count = 0; /* CORRECT: Fixed-width type used */

Example 2:
----------

Bad Example:

.. code-block:: c

    long buffer_size = 1024; /* INCORRECT: "long" type is platform-dependent */

Good Example:

.. code-block:: c

    size_t buffer_size = 1024; /* CORRECT: Using "size_t" for memory size */

Example 3:
----------

Bad Example:

.. code-block:: c

    int is_active = 1; /* INCORRECT: Using "int" for a boolean value */

Good Example:

.. code-block:: c

    bool is_active = true; /* CORRECT: Using "bool" for boolean values */

General Guidelines
------------------

- Always use fixed-width integer types (`uint8_t`, `int32_t`, etc.) for clarity and portability.

- Use `int_fastN_t` for performance when a specific size isn't required but speed is essential.

- Use `size_t` for variables related to memory sizes or object counts.

- Avoid using platform-dependent types like `long`, `short`, or `int`.

- Use `bool` for boolean values instead of integers.

- Use `typedef` to simplify complex data structures and make them easier to work with.
