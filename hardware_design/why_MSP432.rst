Why the MSP432
==============

The MSP432, previously considered, is a microcontroller from Texas Instruments designed for low-power applications with a strong focus on energy efficiency and performance.

Advantages
~~~~~~~~~~

- **Low Power Consumption**: Designed to operate efficiently with minimal power.
- **High Precision**: Offers high precision in analog measurements with its integrated ADC.
- **Ease of Use**: Simplified development environment with support from Texas Instruments.

Disadvantages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Limited Connectivity**: Lacks built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, requiring additional modules for connectivity.
- **Cost**: Slightly more expensive compared to the ESP32.
- **Community Support**: Less extensive community support and fewer libraries compared to the ESP32.
