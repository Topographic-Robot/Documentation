# Introduction

We're building a robot that can travel across all sorts of terrain, from smooth plains to hilly landscapes, while creating detailed 3D maps of the area.
Our robot isn't just about mapping the groundâ€”it's also equipped to measure temperature, humidity, and air quality, giving a full picture of the environment.

At the heart of our robot is the ESP32 microcontroller, which handles all the data processing and control tasks.
We're using MG946R servo motors to ensure our robot can move smoothly and adapt to different terrains.

This project is all about combining cool tech and practical applications.
By the end, we aim to have a robot that's not only a great mapper but also a valuable tool for anyone interested in environmental monitoring.

## Documentation

All of the docs can be found here including the installation and dependencies.

## mdBook

[mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html) was used to generate these docs.

## Contributing

Anything inside of the Topographic-Robot is free and open source.
You can find the source code in various repos on the [organization](https://github.com/orgs/Topographic-Robot/repositories).
Any issue or feature request can be posted on the GitHub issue tracker for their corresponding repository. Internally Jira
is used to manage features, issues, sprints, the backlog and many other things. This means not everything on Jira will be
attached to GitHub. However, all of the code documentation, and the progression of development will be shown.
